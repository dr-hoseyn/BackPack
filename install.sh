#
# Standalone execution installs the pinned combined test snapshot and its
# optional official helpers. The runtime source is the validated repair cohort;
# this bootstrap exists only on the fork's test branch.
#
# It downloads the prebuilt release tar.gz for this architecture into
# /root/BackPack and installs the binary, verifying it against the checksum
# published with the release. If run inside a source checkout and the download
# fails, it builds from source as a last resort.
# BP_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 deliberately installs this checkout's build instead
# of the latest release, for features not present in a published release yet.
#
# A server that cannot reach GitHub at all installs offline instead: download
# the archive on a machine that can, copy it over, and follow the offline steps
# in the README. Third-party GitHub proxies are deliberately not used — the
# archive and its checksum would arrive through the same proxy, so verifying
# one against the other would prove nothing.
#
# When it finishes it opens the menu automatically (on an interactive terminal).
# Later, reopen it any time with:  sudo backpack
